# SSO Announcment

The next version of Notes for android will depend on Nextcloud Single-Sign-On.

## What do you need to do?

It is recommended, to perform a full synchronisation with the old version of the Notes app, before you upgrade.

You have likely installed an up-to-date version of the [Files app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nextcloud.client). In this case, you will have nothing more to do.
In case you do not have it installed yet, you can get it for free from Play Store or F-Droid.

When you upgrade the Notes app, you will be asked to select an account (which you previously configured at the files app).

It is important that you **select** at the first run **the same account which you already were using** in the Notes app. This will make the first run smooth and make sure, that local edited, but not synced notes won't get lost. 

## Benefits for you

- **:lock: Security benefits:** The notes app does no longer have to store a password itself.
- **:electric_plug: Reliability:** The complete network stack could be removed because all network activities are lead through the files app. This allows us to use e. g. the same stack for self signed certificates.
- **:bulb: Comfort:** You won't have to enter a server address, nor a username or a password. Just pick an existing account from the list.
