# ownCloud Notes
An android client for [ownCloud Notes App](https://github.com/owncloud/notes/).

:construction: **Warning:** This app is beta. This means it is not tested well (only by some VMs and my personal device).

:arrow_forward: **Access:** Since this app is currently not available in any Appstore, i will provide some versions in [my ownCloud instance](http://owncloud.niedermann.it/index.php/s/BOM5V1VZwscFk1k). Feel free to download and distribute. But *be careful*: This kind of installation does not include any kind of automatic updates, so you will have to check manually for new security and feature updates.
